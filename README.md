Description of files:
- `README.md` contains the description of every file in this folder.
- `project.ipynb` contains the required jupyter notebook demonstrating this project.
- `project.html` contains the HTML export of project.ipynb.
- `example_video.mp4` contains an example of the output of our model evaluation used by `project.ipynb` in case you decide not to run the code.
- `src/` contains our code, including the forked cleanrl repository and instructions on how to setup dependencies (`src/README.md`).
- `models/` contains our models, which is only DQN 0.5 sparsity for demonstration purposes.
- `videos/` contains a directory that will be created by the jupyter notebook for storing videos from evaluating the model.
- `.gitignore` is a file that is used in order to not save all our videos to our repository because we are downloading our zip file from our repository and want to save space.
